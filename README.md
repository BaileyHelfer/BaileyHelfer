## Hi there! 😄  

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm Bailey, a Lead Software Engineer at USS Vision, where I build real-time computer vision systems used in high-speed manufacturing environments. On this profile, you’ll find a mix of professional and personal projects — from machine learning pipelines and REST APIs to interactive tools and games.

Some highlights include:  
🧠 [VectorBrain](https://github.com/BaileyHelfer/VectorBrain) – my custom self-hostable RAG assistant for querying sensitive internal documents  
🎮 [Unity 3D Game Project](https://github.com/BaileyHelfer/CIS487-3DGame)  
🎮 [VR Wheelchair Soccer (Unreal Engine)](https://github.com/ajatucker/vr-wheelchair-soccer)  
🤖 [SugarScopeAI](https://github.com/BaileyHelfer/SugarScope_AI) – real-time image classification  
🧠 [Microsoft Lobe Prediction GUI](https://github.com/BaileyHelfer/MicrosoftLobePredictionGUI) – custom ONNX inference tool

### 👨‍💻 About Me  

I graduated from the University of Michigan – Dearborn with a degree in Computer and Information Science. Since then, I’ve worked across the full stack — building Python/FastAPI backends, React and Flutter frontends, PostgreSQL databases, and deploying AI/ML models for defect detection using OpenCV, PyTorch, and Ultralytics.

I'm passionate about building systems that are not only performant but also intuitive and impactful.
